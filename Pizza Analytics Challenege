🔥 Mini Project Completed: The Great Pizza Analytics Challenge! 🍕📊

Today I wrapped up the Great Pizza Analytics Challenge a hands-on SQL mini-project as part of the IDC Challenge | DPDzero learning journey.

Even though I’m posting this a little late 😅 the experience was absolutely worth it…

a hands-on SQL mini-project that pushed me to apply everything from the past 15 days filtering, joins, aggregations, NULL handling, self-joins, and more.
This challenge made me think like a real data analyst working with business data:

how to structure queries, clean datasets, connect tables, and extract insights that actually matter.

🧠 What I worked on:
Exploring pizza categories, sizes & ingredients
Handling missing data using COALESCE
Filtering orders by time, date & price
Breaking down sales performance using SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, and HAVING
Performing multi-table joins and even self joins for price comparisons
Identifying top-selling categories and pizzas never ordered
Creating insights that could help a business improve pricing, inventory, and customer trends

This mini project wasn’t just a practice task it felt like working on a real analytics brief.

If you’re learning SQL I highly recommend challenges like this they help you truly understand how data works together.

Key Insights :
 Pizza sales data reveals 49,574 total units sold at an average price of $16.44. Classic category pizzas dominate as highest-volume driver exceeding Supreme by nearly 3,000 units while the Chicken category’s diverse variety contributes significantly to strong sales position.
