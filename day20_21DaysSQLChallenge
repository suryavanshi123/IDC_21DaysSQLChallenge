### Today's Challenge:

/*Question: Create a trend analysis showing for each service and week: week number, patients_admitted,
 running total of patients admitted (cumulative), 3-week moving average of patient satisfaction 
 (current week and 2 prior weeks), and the difference between current week admissions and the service average.
 Filter for weeks 10-20 only.*/
